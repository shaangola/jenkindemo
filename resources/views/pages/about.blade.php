                <h3 class="itallic-text">Message from MD - Mr. Akash Anand</h3>
                <p class="mb20"> Despite several decades of insurance presence in the country, two most fundamental and
                    critical objectives for insurance remain unfulfilled for vast majority of our population. These are
                    universal coverage and prompt relief in the times of need. Large parts of our rural and semi urban
                    population remain uninsured and even when insurance cover exists, effective relief in times of need
                    is woefully lacking.</p>

                <p class="mb20">These are the yawning gaps that we aspire to fill by bringing insurance to the doorstep
                    of farmers, artisans, labourers and all other neglected people in rural and semi urban India, and
                    ensure that each one of them gets their due service and relief, promptly and effectively, in times
                    of need.</p>

                <p class="mb20">Through a wide network of state-of-art technologies that interconnect a large number of
                    dedicated field personnel amongst the intended beneficiaries, we propose to offer coverage and
                    services at the doorstep of all our customers in rural and semi urban India as much as in the
                    metropolises.</p>
